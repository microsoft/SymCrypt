/**************************************************************************************************
    Low-level Integer API
 **************************************************************************************************
The low-level API allows manipulation of arbitrarily large integers.

The internal representation of large integers is not fixed. It depends on CPU architecture and
on the CPU features available on the exact CPU stepping the current software is running on.
In other words, it can change between different executions of the same binary.
Therefore it is critical that callers refrain from making assumptions about the internal
data format used. SymCrypt numbers should only be manipulated through the SymCrypt
API.

The low-level API allows the caller to allocate the necessary memory for all objects.
This is typically necessary for high-IRQL level callers, callers running in low-memory
environments, and high-performance scenarios where memory has to be pre-allocated.
SymCrypt also provides routines for allocating objects, which makes the API easier
to use. The caller has to provide the allocation functions that SymCrypt uses.

Internal data representation, and consequently the size of objects, can depend on the
exact CPU stepping the code is running on.
For robustness, the allocation size requirements are compile-time properties;
they vary per CPU architecture but do not depend on the exact available CPU features.

General rules:
The functions in the low-level API can impose requirements on their inputs. It is imperative that
these requirements are satisfied for every call; failing to satisfy the requirements leads to undefined
behaviour, including bugchecks, access violations, wrong results, or sometimes even the right result.
CHKed versions of the library add more low-level consistency checks; all binaries should be tested
with a CHKed version of the library to detect any errors that might go unnoticed on FRE versions.

Scratch space:
Many functions in the API require temporary storage for intermediate results.
Some function simply allocate the necessary memory using the caller-provided allocation routines.
Other low-level functions are so fast that the overhead of the allocations would significantly slow
down the computations. These functions require the caller to allocate the memory; this memory
is called the scratch space.

For each function that requires scratch space, there is a macro that determines how much scratch space
must be provided. This macro is a compile-time function of its arguments; if the parameters to the macro
are compile-time constants, then the result is also a compile-time constant. Therefore that
the macro can be used for statically sizing arrays.
The scratch space macros are all non-decreasing in each argument.
Callers that perform multiple operations can use a single scratch space, sized for the largest
argument(s) used. Note that the SYMCRYPT_C_MAX macro implements a compile-time MAX function suitable
for combining different scratch space sizes at compile time.

The scratch space is always passed as a pair or arguments: (pbScratch, cbScratch).
cbScratch needs to be at least as large as the macro definition requires, but may be larger.

Functions that take scratch parameters do not require memory allocation, and will not fail due to
low-memory conditions.
All functions that use memory allocation will return an error indication if a necessary memory
allocation fails. These functions return an error code, or an object pointer which will be NULL if
the allocation fails.
Functions that do not return an error code or object pointer do not use memory allocation.

SymCrypt uses several implementation techniques to minimize the cost of the scratch space parameters.
This is necessary because the cost of the parameter passing by itself is significant in scenarios
such as elliptic-curve operations.
In a FRE build, some functions will ignore the cbScratch parameter and simply assume they get enough space;
in this case the SymCrypt may provide an inline-able function that allow the compiler to optimize the cbScratch parameter
away, completely removing it from the actual code.
In environments where some functions don't need any scratch space, similar optimizations are possible for the
pbScratch parameter.

Scratch and object buffers must all be aligned to SYMCRYPT_ALIGN.

INTEGERS

Integers are internally represented as a sequence of Digits. An INT object with n digits can store
numbers up to (but not including) R^n where R is the _radix_ of the representation.

The radix R, as well as the size and format of a Digit, are internal to the library,
and can depend on CPU architecture, CPU stepping and other run-time decisions. Therefore, callers
need to be especially careful not to make any assumptions about the size of a digit, or the number
of digits needed for any particular computation.

At the same time, most INT operations are defined in terms of Digit sizes, so the caller has to
be aware of digits. This becomes important in the following example. Suppose the radix R =2^256,
and a caller wants to multiply two 384-bit numbers. It takes 2 digits to store a 384-bit number.
The caller knows that the product is 768 bits, which can fit in 3 digits. So the caller might try
to multiply two 2-digit numbers into a 3-digit result, which will not work as the result is 4 digits.

For an INT object of n digits we call the value R^n the capacity of the object. It is the upper bound of
the values that can be stored in the object.

Additionally, there is a maximum number of bits for any integer value that the library supports (2^20 bits
in the current version). This bound is used to ensure that no object sizes and scratch space computations
have a value of magnitude more than 32 bits. Note that the computed upper bounds are very loose and the
actual values are much smaller.

Attempts to create objects larger than this bound will result in NULL being returned. Callers either have
to ensure they do not exceed the bounds, or check that create objects are not NULL before using them. The
rationale behind this approach is to avoid any potential route for malicious inputs to trigger DoS by
taking excessive CPU time which would be indistinguishable from an application hang.


Digit size and radix can vary widely; on some CPU steppings the library might use a digit that contains
128 bits are requires 16 bytes of memory, on another CPU stepping it might use a digit that contains
416 bits and uses 64 bytes of memory.

SAL annotations:
Because the different run-time selected implementations underneath this API might use
different size memory buffers for any one operation, fully accurate SAL annotations are not possible as SAL only
performs static analysis.
Furthermore, adding size parameters to every function would add too much overhead, and sizes are often passed
implicitly. Together with the fact that the same API can be implemented by different implementations, this means
that it isn't possible to write the actual size used in a form that SAL can understand.
Instead we use the following conventions:
-   Pointers to SYMCRYPT_* objects can only be created with functions that provide the right memory buffer size.
-   We annotate each object-pointer with _In_ our _Out_. The SAL engine treats this as just a read/write to
    a single object at the pointer location
-   The CHKed version of SymCrypt adds run-time checking that the various size parameters are correct.
This allows us to have both high performance and good checking of our memory management.

API rationale:
One important choice in this API is whether to pass a (ptr,len) for each INT or just a pointer.
We investigated this issue. The ptr-based API means that there are fewer parameters to pass around,
and generally makes the API simpler. The downside of a ptr-based API is that each INT object has some overhead
and this makes arrays of large integers less efficient, especially since the overhead can be a whole alignment
block.
The problem with the (ptr,len) format is that it isn't clear what length measure to use.
Using the bitsize is inefficient; the internal format might store 29 bits of the number in each 32-bit word,
and that means that the code would have to divide the bitsize by 29 just to find the size of the number.
Division is slow, and therefore this is not a good choice.
Another idea is to have the len parameter be the length of the INT object, in bytes.
But some APIs get really messy. For example, we need an API function to do a multiplication of two same-sized
numbers into a double-sized number. This is such a common operation that we want a separate function for it.
But the storage size of the result might not be twice the storage size of the inputs; if each number has some
fixed overhead then the output object might be smaller than the two times the size of the input objects.
This makes it impossible to write suitable SAL annotations.
For this reason, we use a ptr-based API for integers.

Most crypto algorithms that wish to store arrays of values actually want to store arrays of elements in a
ring modulo an modulus. And for modular operations the caller is already passing the modulus separately, so
there isn't any need to store per-object size information. The API is designed to allow the ModElement for bitsize
B to be smaller than an INT for bitsize B so that implementations can choose to not store any length information in
a ModElement object.

// - pbPassword, cbPassword     The password buffer
// - pbCounter                  If not NULL, receives the counter value of the
//                              successful PWE genration per section 12.4.4.2.2
// - pbRand                     Optional pointer to Rand buffer (see below)
// - pbMask                     Optional pointer to Mask buffer (see below)
//
// The Rand and Mask buffers are optional. If a pointer is not provided then the caller
// has no access to the corresponding value.
// For either of these pointers there are three cases:
//  - If a NULL pointer is provided, the function generates an appropriate value internally,
//      but does not return it to the caller.
//  - If a buffer is provided and the buffer is all-zero, the function generates an appropriate
//      value internally and returns it in the buffer.
//  - If a buffer is provided and the buffer is nonzero, the value in the buffer is used for
//      the corresponding protocol parameter without further validation.
// This last option is useful for testing as it lets the caller specify all the random choices.
// Rand and Mask buffers are MSByte first.
//
// Note: currently this method only supports the NIST P256 curve. If we ever want to support other curves
// we'll update this function to accept a curve parameter and update the SAL annotations
// of the other functions.
