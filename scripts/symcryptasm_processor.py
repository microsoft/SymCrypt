This script enables processing of symcryptasm files so that they can be assembled in a variety of
environments without requiring forking or duplication of source files - symcryptasm files phrase
assembly in an assembler and environment agnostic way.

The current target assemblers are:
    MASM, GAS, and armasm64 (Arm64 assembler which ships with MSVC)
The current target environments are:
    amd64 Windows (using the Microsoft x64 calling convention),
    amd64 Linux (using the SystemV amd64 calling convention),
    arm64 Windows (using the aapcs64 calling convention),
    arm64 Windows (using the arm64ec calling convention), and
    arm64 Linux (using the aapcs64 calling convention)


The plan is to rephrase all remaining .asm in SymCrypt as symcryptasm, extending support as
appropriate to enable this effort.

Normally the processing of symcryptasm files takes place in 2 passes. The first pass is performed by
this symcryptasm_processor.py script, which does the more stateful processing, outputting a .cppasm
file. If the processed symcryptasm file includes other files via the INCLUDE directive, the contents
of the included files are merged at their point of inclusion to generate a single expanded symcryptasm 
file which is saved with a .symcryptasmexp extension to the output folder. For symcryptasm files which 
do not include other files, there's no corresponding .symcryptasmexp file as it would be identical to 
the source file.

The .cppasm files are further processed by the C preprocessor to do more simple stateless text
substitutions, outputting a .asm file which can be assembled by the target assembler for the target
environment.
The exception is when using the armasm64 assembler, which uses the C preprocessor before assembling
its inputs already; so the output of this script is directly assembled by armasm64.

We have set up the intermediate generated files to be created in the output directories in both
razzle and CMake builds.

### symcryptasm syntax ###

Different calling conventions pass arguments to functions in different registers, have differing
numbers of volatile and non-volatile registers, and use the stack in different ways.

We define our own register naming scheme which abstracts away the differences between calling
conventions. The generalities of the naming scheme will be similar across target architectures, but
refer to the Architecture specifics below for details. For the following general information we use
the notation R<n> to denote registers in the symcryptasm register naming scheme.


A leaf function (a function which does not call another function) begins with an invocation of the
FUNCTION_START macro which currently takes 3 mandatory and 2 optional arguments:
1) The function name
    This must be the name that matches the corresponding declaration of the function
2) The number of arguments (arg_count) that the function takes
    These arguments will be accessible in some contiguous region of the symcrypt registers at the
    start of the function
        On amd64 this contiguous region is R1..R<arg_count>
        On arm64 this contiguous region is R0..R<arg_count-1>
    Note: arg_count need not correspond to the exact number of argument in the function declaration
    if the assembly does not use some tail of the arguments
3) The number of registers (reg_count) that the function uses
    These registers will be accessible as R0..R<reg_count-1>
4) Stack allocation size (stack_alloc_size) for local variables (amd64 only)
    This parameter is optional, default = 0 if not provided.
    Allows reserving space for local variables on the stack. This value will be rounded to nearest
    multiple of 8 and the stack pointer will be aligned on 16B boundary. The allocated space does
    not include the space needed to save non-volatile registers or shadow space and for function use only.
    If the function is not nested, rsp will point to the beginning of the buffer after the prologue.
    Otherwise, rsp will point to shadow space, which is right below the allocated buffer on the stack.
    In this case, the function has to access the local buffer by using an offset equal to the size of the
    shadow space (32B).
5) The number of Xmm registers (xmm_reg_count) that the function uses (amd64 only)
    This parameter is optional and can take on values [0,16], default = 0 if not provided.
    If a non-zero value is specified, used registers are assumed to be Xmm0..Xmm<xmm_reg_count-1>
    When xmm_reg_count > 6, used Xmm registers starting from Xmm6 will be saved on the
    stack on amd64 Windows environment.

A leaf function ends with the FUNCTION_END macro, which also takes the function name
    (a FUNCTION_END macro's function name must match the preceding FUNCTION_START's name)

At the function start a prologue is generated which arranges the arguments appropriately in
registers, and saves non-volatile registers that have been requested to be used.
At the function end an epilogue is generated with restores the non-volatile registers and returns.


A nested function (a function which does call another function) is specified similarly, only using
NESTED_FUNCTION_START and NESTED_FUNCTION_END macros. A nested function currently updates and aligns
the stack pointer in the function prologue, and avoids use of the redzone in the SystemV ABI.
Nested functions are not currently supported for Arm64.


A macro begins with an invocation of the MACRO_START macro which takes the Macro name, and variable
number of macros argument names. It ends with MACRO_END.

### Architecture specifics ###

### amd64 ###
We allow up to 15 registers to be addressed, with the names:
Q0-Q14 (64-bit registers), D0-D14 (32-bit registers), W0-W14 (16-bit registers), and B0-B14 (8-bit
registers)
Xmm0-Xmm5 registers may be used directly in assembly too, as in both amd64 calling conventions we
currently support, these registers are volatile so do not need any special handling. If the number
of used Xmm registers specified in FUNCTION_START macro is greater than 6, those registers among
Xmm6..Xmm15 are saved/restored on amd64 Windows. There is no save/restore for Xmm16-Xmm31 as of now.

On function entry we insert a prologue which ensures:
Q0 is the result register (the return value of the function, and the low half of a multiplication)
Q1-Q6 are the first 6 arguments passed to the function

Additionally, there is a special case for functions using mul or mulx instructions, as these
instructions make rdx a special register. Functions using these instructions may address Q0-Q13,
and QH. As rdx is used to pass arguments, its value is moved to another register in the function
prologue. The MUL_FUNCTION_START and MUL_FUNCTION_END macros are used in this case.
    We currently do not support nested mul functions, as we have none of them.

Stack layout for amd64 is as follows. Xmm registers are volatile and not saved on Linux.
                         
            Memory          Exists if
    |-------------------|
    |                   | 
    |   Shadow space    | 
    |                   |
    |-------------------|
    |   Return address  | 
    |-------------------|
    |   Non-volatile    |
    |   general purpose |   reg_count > volatile_registers
    |   registers       |
    |-------------------|
    |   Non-volatile    |
    |   Xmm registers   |   xmm_reg_count > 6 and Windows
    |  (Windows only)   |
    |-------------------|---> 16B aligned
    |                   |
    |   Local variables |   stack_alloc_size > 0
    |                   |
    |-------------------|---> 16B aligned
    |                   |
    |   Shadow space    |   nested
    | (nested function) |
    |-------------------|---> 16B aligned



### arm64 ###
We allow up to 23 registers to be addressed, with the names:
X_0-X_22 (64-bit registers) and W_0-W_22 (32-bit registers)
v0-v7 ASIMD registers may by used directly in assembly too, as in both arm64 calling conventions we
currently support, these registers are volatile so do not need any special handling

X_0 is always the result register and the first argument passed to the function.
X_1-X_7 are the arguments 2-8 passed to the function
